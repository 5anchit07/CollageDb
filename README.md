The College Management API is a web service developed using ASP.NET Core Web API and C#. It leverages MongoDB for data storage and management. The API provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing students and courses within a college. It also handles the relationship between students and courses, allowing students to enroll in courses and retrieve course details.
